# Yield Prediction and Variety Recommender

Improving the procedure for estimating the total amount of seed that needs to be produced can save a global seed company millions of dollars. 
By building a predictive model for the dry yield (how much useful product was harvested/extracted) of crops in Southern India, I was able to develop a procedure for forecasting the dried yield per acre of a farm. Recommending specific high yield varieties to locations within the region was another method that I used to improve the efficiency of the farms. 
The ideas behind this project can be applied to other crops and can be scaled to bigger regions.
